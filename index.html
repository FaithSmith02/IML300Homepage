                Through both of these readings, I was surprised by how intricate the history of computer art is. Considering the large role of women in the development of the field, it is sad to see how much erasure occurs. Especially considering the fact that STEM/STEAM is such a hard field to break into and it is, to a great degree, harder for marginalized groups. I was also surprised by how elaborate and thoughtful the art form as a concept is. One of the artists I chose was Charles Csuri and the idea of statistics as an “interactive art object” is particularly fascinating to me. As a society, of course, we are constantly measuring and analyzing but this also made me think about how by simply operating through life we are gathering data. This allows for a really interesting interdisciplinary approach to self-expression.</p>

            <p>Questions:

                1. Considering the fact that the program for kinostatistics (the visual representation of statistical data) was originally intended to help come up with solutions for societal issues, what are some examples of computer artists who have made large or small scale concrete changes with their art?
                2. What are some ways that artists can cultivate their art styles while working with fast-changing and growing emergent fields like generative art and computer art as a whole?
                3. How will NFTs impact the world of computer art, especially relating to creative expression and artistic ownership?</p>

            <p>This was an incredibly engaging read to me. I have recently begun learning more about afro-pessimism and racial slavery, but I have not learned about it in relation to technology. It was an incredibly smart comparison to make, using the transition from white to a black screen as a way for the reader to almost visualize the exclusion of blackness from literally every space. It made me think about whiteness as default or standard, something seen as good or proper or even just normal. It may be hard for some to understand how the color of a screen is related to white supremacy, but thinking about who cultivated these spaces and how deeply ingrained white supremacy is in all parts of our society it’s definitely not surprising.</p>

            <p>Questions:
                1. What are other lasting effects of military funding and, as a result, white-centrism and POC exclusion in technology?
                2. Is there any hope in de-centering whiteness? If so, what are some potential steps that companies can take?
                3. How can we actively engage with the tech industry/technology in a way that centers our needs and not the needs of the corporation who developed the tech and the general white standard?</p>

            <p>This was such an interesting talk. Lauren McCarthy’s unique disposition is what makes it so riveting. In the past, she was both the surveyor and the surveyed. To me, the concept of “follower” was both interesting but also scary, I visited the website and it still seems to be up and running. It made me think of whether I would choose to participate in a program like that, “Someone”, or even “Lauren”. But then I realized that I used to have a google home and I used to admire my friends’ families who had Apple HomePods and Alexas. Although I have grown out of the admiration, is that because it has just been perceived as inaccessible or is it because I am uncomfortable with a presence that is always there. The idea of choosing to be followed was incredibly fascinating, but also incredibly privileged. Lauren actually mentions this, going over how many people don’t have a choice of whether they are followed or not, for a variety of reasons. Although she mentions women, I started to think about the phenomenon of “when you’re a person of color, you’re never truly alone”. Regardless of whether we like it or not, someone is always watching over our shoulders, waiting for us to mess up. I always joke that I don’t care if someone is stealing my data. But I do actually care, I’ve just developed into an apathetic position because of the fact that not only my data but generally who I have already been taken and sold to a whole bunch of companies, without my consent.</p>

            <p>Questions:
                1. While discussing privacy vs. convenience, what are the pros and cons to each argument, and how do you think they outweigh each other?
                2. In thinking about the option to choose. With increasing surveillance and data collection being integrated into every part of our lives, does consent/the choice to be surveyed truly exist?
                3. How long do you think it will be before the definition of privacy changes, or privacy as we know it ceases to exist?</p>

                <a href="http://thecomposingrooms.com/research/reading/2013/e-flux_Hito%20Steyerl_15.pdf">In Defense of the Poor Image</a>
            </p>
            <p>One of the concepts that intrigued me the most in this reading was the idea of culture as a commodity and in turn how that affected the use of cinema as a mode of education and a way to cry out of oppression. This is especially intriguing to me in relation to the poor image and the way that its role has changed throughout society. have never really thought critically about low-quality images, especially not in their relation to capitalism and neoliberalism beyond the issue of accessibility. As poor images became more accessible they were no longer just a representation of breaking the bounds of commodified media and became material and a medium in which anything and everything can be communicated. It can be an act of protest by simply just existing. Another thing that really interested me was Juan Garcia Espinosa’s idea that perfect cinema is “almost always reactionary cinema” and that imperfect cinema is one that “strives to overcome the divisions of labor within class society”. Hito Steyerl’s argument that the poor image is in line with Espinosa’s idea of imperfect cinema while perfect cinema is “the concept of cinema as a flagship store.” I would love to read more on this idea as it relates to white supremacy and it’s intersection with class divides.</p>
            <p>Questions:

                1. How do you think that the emphasis on the high-quality image and the removal of anything that doesn’t fall in line with the ideas of the cinematic echo chamber relate to not only class divides (like we’ve seen in this reading) but also white supremacy?
                2. Do you think there ever be a time in which the poor image is prioritized over the high-quality image, in favor of its message?
                3. How do the concepts we read today apply to the resurrection of physical film and the use of older/deadstock cameras to create a certain aesthetic?</p>

            </p>
            <p>Althgorigmic bias is always something that I have been interested in. I constantly find myself thinking/noticing all of the little ways that white supremacy is ingrained in our society, especially in relation to the field of technology. I actually experienced something related over the weekend. There’s a new payment program that’s been popping up around campus whose purpose is to “get rid of the wallet”. It uses your face as a way to pay(which I already found slightly concerning), and unfortunately, at the time it was the chosen form of payment for one of the only available vegetarian options at the event I was attending. No matter how hard I tried to sign up, it would not recognize my face. Glasses or no glasses, mask on my chin or no mask at all. This was made even more apparent and frustrating when I was watching the different people around me sign up easy peasy. Although I couldn’t find much information on who actually runs this program, every single time I see it advertised, it’s advertised by what looks to be the same person in a few different forms. Although they are not the ones coding, it’s an obvious representation of who the company envisions its target audience to be and who they actually care about serving. This then ties into what Joy Buolamwini describes as inclusive coding. There's definitely an issue at the base, who’s coding, how are they coding, and why are they coding. I think the who and the how is especially important in this case, whoever was developing this could’ve worked on a more inclusive training set and tested the program a little more thoroughly. It truly raises the question of why this was an issue and who allowed this to happen in the first place?
            </p>
            <p>Questions:1. What are some other ways that algorithmic bias is present in mainstream uses of technology?
                2. How can we make algorithmic bias more widely known?
                3. How can we find a balance between more inclusive AI and prioritizing the safety and protection of the user’s information?</p>

            </p>
            <p>This viewing of The Danger of A Single Story brought up a few thoughts within me. It made me think about how the media we take in influences our empathy, our critical thinking skills, our ability to understand nuance, and so much more. Judging someone based on one story is an issue of discernment, but it’s part human condition and part social conditioning. The recent trends of media production (visual and written) appear to have reduced media literacy to what sometimes feels like an incredible low. It also made me think about my own experience with the single-story, or rather, 50 stories about the same character(iykyk). Stories can sometimes feel like reflections of real life, and when you feel like you have no place in a story it can feel like you have no place in the real world. Trying to fit me and the people around me into boxes constructed by superficial stories that were spoonfed to me left me with a good amount of hurt and a few things to work through.</p>
            <p>Questions:
                1. What are ways that we can help uplift multiple stories?
                2. Why is it that negative storylines are always pushed before positive stories, especially in the case of marginalized people?
                3. How can we make sure that we avoid having a flattened view of other people/cultures?</p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raZf_2tcUo0&ab_channel=AriCiano">Omni-Specialized Design for Beautiful Futures</a>
            </p>
            <p>Overall, this presentation was refreshing. I have not really seen someone with such a passionate and dynamic view of design. I really liked the idea of designing “with” not “for”, and design being almost like a community practice. This presentation was also my first introduction to speculative art. It’s so interesting to think about simply creating. I am somewhat in the same boat as Ari, although I wouldn’t say that I create activist work, a lot of the things that I do and the topics I like to explore are related to my social identity. As a black person, there are very few spaces where I can just exist, so thinking about a space where people can just create outside of their social condition sounds very hopeful. It sounds like a freeing space and it also made me think about how simply creating spaces like this or trying your best to just exist and create art (even if only for a short period of time) could actually be one of the steps we can take to bring this future to life. Lately, I've been thinking about radical existence and how sometimes simply surviving can be an act of “protest” and as a result, I think a lot about what it means to just exist, or if it is even possible to just exist. This viewing gave me a new perspective and more food for thought.</p>
            <p>Questions:
                1. How could design as a community practice help us structure future systems? In what ways do you think we would see change?
                2. Is it possible to exist outside of your social disposition? If not, how can one create outside of their social existence? Is it possible to do one and not the other?
                3. How can speculative art/design actually be used for the future, especially if the ideation is set xso far away?</p>
